[Shabu Shabu](https://shabu-shabu.theory-a.com/) is a "Full Pot" development template that scaffolds an application using modern tools optimized for rapid prototyping, side projects, and MVP iteration. It uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) as the core technologies and also sets up boilerplate for useful tooling such as ESLint, Typescript, [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Prettier](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

It is inspired by [shadcn's](https://prettier.io/) philosophy of just giving you code rather than dependencies and documentation. It avoids the over-processing of too many moving pieces to emphasize a few high quality raw ingredients. Just fork the template and start developing.

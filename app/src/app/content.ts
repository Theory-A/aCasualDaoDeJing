      In ancient times, the sages spun,
      Not to outshine, but simplify for everyone.
      The people are hard to lead, they knew,
      For with their wisdom, troubles grew.

      Governing with smarts, you invite theft,
      Without it, a nation's fortune is left.
      To know these truths is to see the way,
      Grasping the mystery day by day.

      Deep is the virtue of the mystic path,
      Far-reaching, against the grain, it hath
      A twist, a turn, the grand align,
      Leading to harmony, purely divine.

      Here, in the realm of rhyme, we see
      A sage's lesson from the Dao De Jing:
      Enlighten not with intellect's glare,
      But by simplifying, showing care.

      With less wisdom on display,
      Less chaos will come your way.
      Smart rule invites cunning foes,
      Simple governance nurtures, grows.

      In knowing both, balance is found,
      With virtue deep and tightly wound.
      It's profound, so vast, it circles back,
      In great harmony, there's nothing you lack.

      The wise, if they wish to lift folks high,
      Must speak in soft tones, not command the sky.

      Walk behind them all, and their trust solidify.

      Second is frugality, from which bounty flows.

      Third, dare not to be the world's leading light,
      Thus, in humility, you gain true might.
      Compassion brings courage, this is clear,

      With these treasures, greatness is taught.
      But abandon these, and what have you got?
      You'll perish indeed, in your own plot.

      For with compassion, in battle, you'll win,
      And in defense, an unbreakable skin.
